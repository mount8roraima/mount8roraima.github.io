  <p>Stamp of "Millie," the bilingual parrot</p>
  <p>My stamp collection comprises a broad swath of images and stories. 
    <p>It has been a hobby of mine for many years.

<p>In 1967, Guyana, in year 2 as an independent nation, participated in 
  <p>an exposition of its wares in Montreal. During the construction of 
    <p>the exhibition pavilion, one of the contributors, Millie the Parrot, 
      <p>overheard the crude discourse of the diverse workers. Millie soon 
        <p>learned to swear in the English and French languages. Victoria Fromkin, 
          <p>in “An Introduction to Language”, 2002, page 23, teaches us that 
            <p>“Talking birds such as parrots and mynah birds are capable of 
              <p>faithfully reproducing words and phrases of human language 
                <p>that they have heard, but their utterances carry no meaning”. 
                  <p>The moralistic burgeois Guyanese embassy officials were “embarrassed” 
                    <p>and returned Millie to Georgetown before the exhibition started. 
                      <p>These officials could have learned from Fromkin. Millie had become 
                        <p>a celebrity and her image was captured on a postage stamp with a 
  <p>caption that read, “Millie the Bilingual Parrot”</p>.
