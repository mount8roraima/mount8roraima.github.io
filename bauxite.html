  <P><h1>Photo of the Bauxite company</h1></p>
  <p>
Post independence, the Guyana government, under the leadership of The Peoples’ 
    <p>National Congress (PNC) and with the critical support of the opposition, 
      <p>Peoples’ Progressive Party (PPP or 3P) nationalized the aluminum bauxite 
        <p>Canadian company, DEMBA, the Demerara Bauxite Company. My friends 
          <p>and I thought the new name should be “WEBAU”,“WE Bauxite Company '', 
            <p>because it was now OUR bauxite. The government called it GUYBAU or 
              <p>Guyana Bauxite Company. It was good grade bauxite but sales 
                <p.surpluses fell because of boycotts by multinational corporations, 
                             <p>as a way to punish the aspirations of the Guyanese people.
                <p>Another reason for the drop in sales was due to mismanagement. 
                  <p>The expatriates who ran the Company for decades returned to North America.

  <p>The postage stamp speaks to the bravery of nationalization by the people of Guyana.</p>
