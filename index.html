  <P>A stamp of Eddy Grant</p>
  <p>In this exercise I will create a website to showcase my stamp collection. 
   <p>Various pages will present different aspects of the hobby which I love and to which I devote tender loving care. 
     <p>From a description with emphasis on the story of a bilingual parrot and to nationalization of 
       <p>the commanding heights of an emerging independent nationâ€™s economy, to depictions of 
         <p>flora and fauna, this collection will build upon some of the concepts of micro and macro IA.
<p>IA will be applied to the website, rubric and all. I hope that my audience will find this information

<p>useful

<p>usable

<p>Acceptable.

<p>And they will join me in the beautiful world of philately.</p>
